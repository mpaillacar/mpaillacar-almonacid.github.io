This paper explores the relationship between heterogeneous beliefs about asset returns and wealth concentration in a general equilibrium framework. When agents hold different beliefs about the future performance of risky assets, this creates opportunities for risk-sharing that can lead to significant wealth redistribution. I develop a model where belief heterogeneity endogenously generates wealth inequality and affects equilibrium risk premia. The model shows that agents with more optimistic beliefs about risky assets tend to accumulate more wealth over time, leading to increased wealth concentration. This mechanism also affects asset pricing, as the distribution of wealth across agents with different beliefs influences the market price of risk. The results suggest that belief heterogeneity can be an important driver of both wealth inequality and asset market dynamics.
