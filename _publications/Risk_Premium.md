title: "Endogenous Risk Premia and Wealth Distribution"
collection: publications
category: conferences
excerpt: >
  We develop an infinite-horizon continuous-time incomplete-markets economy in
  which households face uninsurable idiosyncratic income risk and aggregate
  risk and invest through a financial intermediary sector. The intermediary's
  relative wealth endogenously drives risk premia, and return volatility,
  generating two-way feedback loops between asset returns and the wealth
  distribution.
