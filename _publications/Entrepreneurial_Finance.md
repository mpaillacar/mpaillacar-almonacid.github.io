title: "Entrepreneurial Finance with Robustly Optimal Policies"
collection: publications
category: conferences
excerpt: >
  I develop a continuous-time entrepreneurial finance model in which a
  risk-averse entrepreneur and competitive financiers are jointly robust to
  unspanned idiosyncratic uncertainty from technology adoption. Robustness
  shapes adoption, consumption-portfolio, and debt policy, determining
  state-dependent security valuation and endogenous default.
