**Welcome!**

------
I am a Ph.D. candidate in Financial Economics at [UCL](https://www.ucl.ac.uk), where I am affiliated with the [UCL Centre for Finance](https://www.centreforfinance.org/index.htm). My research examines how financial markets—and the forces behind asset prices—shape wealth distribution, and vice versa. 

------
Before joining UCL, I was an Economic Analyst at the Economic Research Area of the [Central Bank of Chile](https://portalbiblioteca.bcentral.cl/en/web/banco-central/).

**Research Interests**: Macro-Finance, Corporate Finance, Asset Pricing.
