**Welcome!**

I am a Ph.D. candidate in Financial Economics at [UCL](https://www.ucl.ac.uk). My current research focuses on understanding the role of risk premium in shaping wealth inequality and the channels through which it affects the distribution of wealth.

Before joining UCL, I was an Economic Analyst at the Economic Research Area of the [Central Bank of Chile](https://portalbiblioteca.bcentral.cl/en/web/banco-central/).
